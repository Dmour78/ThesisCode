The proposed data management system for remote lab wThe proposed data management system for remote lab was piloted on an NI ELVIS II test equipment which is consisting of DATEx experiments. The lab was programmed in LabVIEW graphical language installed in the web server, and enabled by a programmable automation controller to run the experiments. Exper-iments make use of the Emona DATEx telecommunications trainer kit together with the NI ELVIS I or II platform and NI LabVIEW running on a ?????????, Each DATEx experiment presents an interesting, hands-on learning experience for the students, DATEx is actually a true engineering modeling system where students see that the block diagrams The proposed data management system for remote lab was piloted on an NI ELVIS II test equipment which is consisting of DATEx experiments.
